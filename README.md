# Information
This repo is a fork of the ErgoDox Mechanical Keyboard pcb and Litster's acrylic case designs (both standard and full hand).

This variation of the design has a two main goals:
* Replace the Mini B port with a Type C port while maintaining reversibility of the PCB design.
* Keep the rest of the design as unchanged as possible.
  - The idea is that most case designs should still be compatible (with at most minor adjustments)
